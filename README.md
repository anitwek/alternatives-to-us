# Non-U.S. Alternatives List

A collectively curated list of non-US-based alternatives to popular services, because it is time to prioritise our privacy, security, and digital sovereignty.

## 🚨 Did you know?  

🚩 Under the **US PATRIOT Act**, any data stored on US-based services can be accessed by the government—without your consent.  
🚩 The **Five Eyes alliance** (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) shares intelligence, meaning your private info can be surveilled across multiple countries.  
🚩 **Even non-US services can be pressured to hand over data if they have servers or operations in the US**

## 📌 Why This List Matters

**Big Tech monopolies track, monetize, spy on us and control our digital lives**. Now, it's more important than ever to **seek independent alternatives** that respect user rights. 
This list aims to:  

✔️ **Promote data privacy.**  
*While not every service on this list is entirely free from international surveillance networks (**Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, 14 Eyes, PRISM, FISA, etc.**), our mission is to promote alternatives that reduce dependency on them and enhance user privacy. Over time, we aim to refine this list, keeping only the safest and most secure services.*  
✔️ **Reduce reliance on U.S. Big Tech & surveillance-heavy platforms.**  
✔️ **Promote services that respect user privacy better than their mainstream counterparts.**  
✔️ **Encourage transparency by allowing the community to vet and flag questionable alternatives.**  
✔️ **Encourage global accessibility by promoting platforms available to users worldwide without geopolitical restrictions.**  
✔️ **Break free from corporate monopolies that push anti-competitive policies and exploit user data.**

## 📌 Contributing & Vetting

This list is a **community-driven effort** and we encourage:  

✔ **Contributions** – If you know of a service that fits, submit it!  
✔ **Verification** – If a service **claims** to be privacy-friendly but has questionable policies, leave a comment for discussion.  
✔ **Transparency** – If an entry is **funded by or connected to US interests**, flag it for review.
✔ **Continuous Improvement**: **The MAIN GOAL is to refine and shorten this list, prioritizing ‼️ONLY‼️ services that are truly independent from Five Eyes & similar surveillance networks.**
