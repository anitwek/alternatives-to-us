# Non-U.S. Alternatives List

A collectively curated list of non-US-based alternatives to popular services, because it is time to prioritise our privacy, security, and digital sovereignty.

## 🚨 Did You Know? 

🚩 **If you use a US-based service, your private data is NOT yours.**  

🚩 **The US PATRIOT Act** lets the government **access your data WITHOUT your consent**—no warrant needed. Yes, even if you're not American.  

🚩 **The Five Eyes Alliance (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)** means that if **one country gets your data, they ALL get it.** Your info can be passed around intelligence agencies **without you knowing.**  

🚩 **Even if you use a non-US service, you’re NOT safe.** If the company has **servers, offices, or employees in the US,** it can be legally forced to **hand over your data to the US government.**  

🚩 **Big Tech is NOT your friend.** Companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon **comply with these laws** and **give your info to intelligence agencies on request.**  

🚩 **Once your data is in their hands, it NEVER disappears.** Even **deleted files, old emails, and private messages** can be **stored, recovered, and used against you.**  

## 📌 Why This List Matters

**Big Tech monopolies track, monetize, spy on us and control our digital lives**. Now, it's more important than ever to **seek independent alternatives** that respect user rights. 
This list aims to:  

✔️ **Promote data privacy.**  
*While not every service on this list is entirely free from international surveillance networks (**Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, 14 Eyes, PRISM, FISA, etc.**), our mission is to promote alternatives that reduce dependency on them and enhance user privacy. Over time, we aim to refine this list, keeping only the safest and most secure services.*  
✔️ **Reduce reliance on U.S. Big Tech & surveillance-heavy platforms.**  
✔️ **Promote services that respect user privacy better than their mainstream counterparts.**  
✔️ **Encourage transparency by allowing the community to vet and flag questionable alternatives.**  
✔️ **Encourage global accessibility by promoting platforms available to users worldwide without geopolitical restrictions.**  
✔️ **Break free from corporate monopolies that push anti-competitive policies and exploit user data.**

## 📌 Contributing & Vetting

This list is a **community-driven effort** and we encourage:  

✔ **Contributions** – If you know of a service that fits, submit it!  
✔ **Verification** – If a service **claims** to be privacy-friendly but has questionable policies, leave a comment for discussion.  
✔ **Transparency** – If an entry is **funded by or connected to US interests**, flag it for review.
✔ **Continuous Improvement**: **The MAIN GOAL is to refine and shorten this list, prioritizing ‼️ONLY‼️ services that are truly independent from Five Eyes & similar surveillance networks.**
